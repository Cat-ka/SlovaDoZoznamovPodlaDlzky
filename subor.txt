As
you
might
have
guessed
by
now
the
code
kept
failing
Even
though
both
entities
started
out
exactly
one
meter
apart
had
the
same
starting
speed
and
were
accelerating
with
the
same
speed
using
the
same
algorithm
the
integer
value
kept
returning
the
same
x
value
once
in
a
while
and
thus
the
code
kept
failing
